# Software Design & Architecture: Lab Solutions
## Spring 2024 (Fast Nuces Lhr)

This repository contains the solutions to the SDA Lab questions from my lectures at the Spring 2024 semester at FAST NUCES Lhr. These solutions are intended to help students who are struggling with understanding the concepts and solving the assignments.

_**Note:** that these solutions are provided for the Lab (subject), not the theory subject. Therefore, they may not be useful for the theory subject._

### Resources:

The UML Diagrams used here are created by [StarUML](https://staruml.io/) software. The Files ending with `.mdj` extension are the Source Files for the UML Diagrams and can be edited using the StarUML Software and the Files ending with `.java` extension are Java language Source Code Files which can be used, if Java is installed on your Machine. I am using the [VSCode Java Coding pack](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial) on Windows.
